This is an exploration of a CSV from the dating app OkCupid.  As a showcase of what was learned in a Data Scientist: Machine Learning Specialist certification, I experimented with various machine learning algorithms.
After exploring the data, I realized that there were a considerable amount of users who didn't include a zodiac sign in their profile.  So, I attempted to train a model on many other features in order to predict missing 
zodiac signs.
